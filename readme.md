# JavaScript

I put together a collection of JavaScript functions I use. I found them exceptionally useful and I hope you will too.

Note: This collection is ESM only and cannot be used with CommonJS.

You can use these libraries in the frontend even if you don't use a bundler. Please read [this article](https://zellwk.com/blog/node-modules-in-frontend-without-bundlers/) for more info.

## Installation and usage

You can install the library with npm:

```bash
npm install @zellwk/javascript
```

Then import whatever functions you need by traversing the folders.

## What's here?

You can explore the `src` folder to find what's available.

These functions are categorized according to the following folders:

- `browser` — Browser-only stuff
- `node` — Node-only stuff
- `utils` — Things that work on both browser and Node

You will find documentation for each utility in their respective readme files.

## WIP Warning

This repository is always a Work in Progress. I may change anything anytime!

## Changelog

Detailed changes for each release are documented in [the release notes](https://github.com/zellwk/javascript/releases).
